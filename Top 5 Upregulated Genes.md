EMILIN2, or Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 2, is a gene whose functional product may be in charge of the anchorage of smooth muscle cells to elastic fibers, and may also participate in the process of forming these elastic fibers, and in the regulation of vessel assembly.

DTHD1, also called Death Domain Containing 1, is a gene that plays a role in the creation of complexes in signaling pathways and those for programmed cell death

POU3F4, known as POU Class 3 Homeobox 4, is a gene that codes for a POU-III neural transcription factor class member. Its functional product is believed to be take part in inducing the differentiation of striatal neuron-precursors by mediating epigenetic signals.

PI16, known as Peptidase Inhibitor 16, is a gene speculated to be involved in the downregulation of peptidase activity. Its functional product may serve as a marker after prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

VEPH1, or Ventricular Zone Expressed PH Domain Containing 1, is a gene whose product is predicted to enable phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate binding activity. It is involved in negative regulation of SMAD protein signal transduction and negative regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway.
